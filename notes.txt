mergeStatus of A into B:
	All of B's cells are exposed
	There isn't some C & D such that B > C (B is collapsed after C) or B > D and C & D are separated by B
		* separated with or without gravity
		* separated can include (partially obscured)?
	* B doesn't depend on folding

0 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells is less than or equal to the target
1 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells is greater than the target but less than or equal to the maximum
2 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells exceeds the maximum
3 constraints not satisfied

Need to retry expanding shapes if the reason for failing was column not yet tall enough.
Add horizontal fold probability

No fall-trigger mechanic:

Blocks 	Shift
 A 		2
BB 		-
 A 		1
 CC		-
 A 		0

B < A
C < A

With fall-trigger mechanic

 aa
BB
 A
 CC
 A

a < B (so "A" and "a" don't touch)
C < A (and C automatically triggers A)

Can only split up the blocks up belonging to a particular shape in a particular column once unless another layer has been added to an intervening block. Can only shift up Row 0 if the shape being moved was the last one added because falling to the bottom also auto-triggers annihilation.

One shift but shifted more than one position is okay:
Blocks 	Shift
A 		2
CC 		-
BB 		-
A 		0


   | A  |
B  | B  |
   | DA | D
   | C  | C
   | A  |

(where DA means D is placed on top of A.)
B < D
C < A
D < A

Blocks 	Can Shift Up (column with As)?
A 			Yes
A 			Yes
A 			Yes

A 			No
A 			Yes
CC 			Yes
A 			Yes

A  |		Yes
DA | D 		Yes
C  | C 		Yes
A  |		Yes

Shifting up more than one position at once...

mergeStatus of A into B:
	All of B's cells are exposed
	There isn't some C & D such that B > C (B is collapsed after C) or B > D and C & D are separated by B
		* separated with or without gravity
		* separated can include (partially obscured)?
	* B doesn't depend on folding

0 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells is less than or equal to the target
1 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells is greater than the target but less than or equal to the maximum
2 constraints satisfied and the total number of cells exceeds the maximum
3 constraints not satisfied

Need to retry expanding shapes if the reason for failing was column not yet tall enough

const couldFold = random.next() <= foldProbability;
foldProbability = parseFloat(document.getElementById('fold-probability').value) / 100;
